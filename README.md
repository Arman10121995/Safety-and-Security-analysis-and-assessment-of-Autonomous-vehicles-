# Safety-and-Security-analysis-and-assessment-of-Autonomous-vehicles-

The obstacles to creating and using autonomous cars are examined in this research. It is essential to ensure that these vehicles are built, tested, and used to minimise the danger of mishaps or malicious assaults as their use grows. The first section of the research looks at the level of autonomy, the basic design of highly and completely autonomous cars, and the present regulatory environment for autonomous vehicles, including the function of governmental bodies and trade associations. It emphasizes the necessity of a unified regulatory strategy that strikes a balance between innovation and safety. The report briefly discusses the importance of security and safety for autonomous cars. The main issues that must be resolved to enable the safe and secure operation of autonomous cars are then covered, such as the necessity of strong cybersecurity safeguards, efficient testing processes, ready infrastructure, liability, and insurance, among others. Finally, the research offers several suggestions to assist assure the secure development and use of autonomous cars for policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders. The necessity for standardized testing procedures, redundant, diversified, cutting-edge sensor and artificial intelligence approaches, greater investment in cybersecurity research, etc., are some of these proposals.
